            <p1>The renowned painter Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Post-Impressionist Dutch painter. He was born in the town of Zundert, Netherlands on the 30th of March 1853. He decided to become a fully fledged artist around the age of 27 - a decision which would have a massive impact on the history of art. To this day, he is seen as one of the most famous and influential figures in Western art history. In his time, he had produced roughly 2,100 pieces of artwork; with about 860 of them being oil paintings. Unfortunately, most of the works he made were created in the last two years of his life. He painted a range of topics, such as: still lifes, landscapes, portraits and self portraits. </p>

            <p>His technique can be summarized as being bold, dramatic and expressive. This was mainly displayed through his impulsive brushstrokes and the use of vibrant colour throughout many of his artwork. Vincent often liked to paint the locations he visited in his lifetime, often the Dutch countryside. When you look at his paintings, you can almost imagine you are there alongside him.</p>

            <p>The artwork van Gogh created became incredibly more popular following his death, especially in the late 20th century. His work was now selling for astounding amounts of money at auctions around the world. In addition, many musuems and gallerys now feature an exhibiton dedicated to him and his work; the largest one of these is the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam. In  addition to his art, there is a vast erray of his published letters. Van Gogh is often mythologized in the modern world as a classic troubled artist. Throughout his career he was never garnered much commercially. He struggled with severe depression and poverty, which eventually led to his suicide at age thirty-seven. He died on the 29th of July 1890.</p1>
